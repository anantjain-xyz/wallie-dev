# PR feedback sweep

## When to run

- Before transitioning the issue to `In Review` for the first time.
- After every change prompted by review (push → reviewer reacts → repeat).
- When a `Todo` redispatch lands on a PR that already has comments — sweep before doing new work.

## Channels

Reviewer feedback arrives across three channels — gather all three:

1. **Top-level PR comments** (issue thread):
   ```sh
   pr=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
   repo=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
   gh api --paginate "repos/${repo}/issues/${pr}/comments"
   ```
2. **Inline review comments** (line-anchored):
   ```sh
   gh api --paginate "repos/${repo}/pulls/${pr}/comments"
   ```
3. **Review states** (approved / changes requested / commented):
   ```sh
   gh api --paginate "repos/${repo}/pulls/${pr}/reviews"
   ```

`--paginate` is mandatory: GitHub REST list endpoints page at 30 by default, so a busy PR can silently hide later comments and trick the sweep into declaring "no actionable feedback" when there is.

The `Manual QA Plan` comment, when present, sharpens UI/runtime coverage — read it before transitioning.

## Resolution rules

Treat every actionable comment (human or bot, top-level or inline) as **blocking** until one of these is true:

- Code/tests/docs updated to address it. Push the fix, then reply where the comment lives (inline reply for inline comments; top-level for top-level) noting the commit SHA.
- Explicit, justified pushback. Reply on the same thread with: acknowledge → rationale → offer alternative or follow-up. Keep it concrete; don't dismiss with "won't do".

Mirror each item and its resolution in the workpad's plan so the trail is auditable.

## Replying to inline comments

The endpoint for an inline reply is the *pulls* endpoint (not *issues*) and `in_reply_to` must be the numeric review-comment id, not a GraphQL node id:

```sh
gh api -X POST "repos/${repo}/pulls/${pr}/comments" \
  -f body='<reply text>' \
  -F in_reply_to=<numeric-comment-id>
```

A 404 here usually means the wrong endpoint (you used `issues`) or insufficient scope.

## Classifying feedback

Per comment, pick one mode and state it in your reply before changing code:

- **accept** — fix it, then reply with the commit SHA.
- **clarify** — ask a focused question; don't change code yet.
- **push back** — disagree; reply with rationale + alternative; only proceed without changes if the rationale is solid.

Correctness concerns must be addressed (or validated as inapplicable, with proof). Style/scope concerns can be deferred with a clear reason.

## Loop

Repeat sweep → fix → reply → re-run validation → push, until **zero outstanding actionable comments** *and* PR checks are green on the latest commit. Only then move the issue to `In Review`.

- Before completing review work, inspect all unresolved review threads, address the actionable items, and verify the resulting diff and checks.
